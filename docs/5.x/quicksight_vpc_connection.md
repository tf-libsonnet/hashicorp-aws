## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`aws.quicksight_vpc_connection.new` injects a new `aws_quicksight_vpc_connection` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    aws.quicksight_vpc_connection.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `aws.quicksight_vpc_connection` using the reference:

    $._ref.aws_quicksight_vpc_connection.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ aws_quicksight_vpc_connection.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `aws_account_id` (`string`): Set the `aws_account_id` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `aws_account_id` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `dns_resolvers` (`list`): Set the `dns_resolvers` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `dns_resolvers` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name` (`string`): Set the `name` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `role_arn` (`string`): Set the `role_arn` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `security_group_ids` (`list`): Set the `security_group_ids` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `subnet_ids` (`list`): Set the `subnet_ids` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `tags` (`obj`): Set the `tags` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `tags` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `vpc_connection_id` (`string`): Set the `vpc_connection_id` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [aws.quicksight_vpc_connection.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`aws.quicksight_vpc_connection.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `quicksight_vpc_connection`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [aws.quicksight_vpc_connection.new](#fn-new), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `aws_account_id` (`string`): Set the `aws_account_id` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `aws_account_id` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `dns_resolvers` (`list`): Set the `dns_resolvers` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `dns_resolvers` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name` (`string`): Set the `name` field on the resulting object.
  - `role_arn` (`string`): Set the `role_arn` field on the resulting object.
  - `security_group_ids` (`list`): Set the `security_group_ids` field on the resulting object.
  - `subnet_ids` (`list`): Set the `subnet_ids` field on the resulting object.
  - `tags` (`obj`): Set the `tags` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `tags` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `vpc_connection_id` (`string`): Set the `vpc_connection_id` field on the resulting object.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [aws.quicksight_vpc_connection.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
  - An attribute object that can be used with [tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) to construct a new `quicksight_vpc_connection` resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn withAwsAccountId

```ts

Terraform resource block to set or update the aws_account_id field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `aws_account_id` field.


### fn withDnsResolvers

```ts
withDnsResolvers()
```

`aws.list.withDnsResolvers` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `list`
Terraform resource block to set or update the dns_resolvers field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`list`): The value to set for the `dns_resolvers` field.


### fn withName
