## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`aws.security_group.new` injects a new `aws_security_group` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    aws.security_group.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `aws.security_group` using the reference:

    $._ref.aws_security_group.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ aws_security_group.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `description` (`string`): Set the `description` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `egress` (`list`): Set the `egress` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `egress` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `ingress` (`list`): Set the `ingress` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `ingress` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name` (`string`): Set the `name` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `name` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name_prefix` (`string`): Set the `name_prefix` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `name_prefix` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `revoke_rules_on_delete` (`bool`): Set the `revoke_rules_on_delete` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `revoke_rules_on_delete` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `tags` (`obj`): Set the `tags` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `tags` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `tags_all` (`obj`): Set the `tags_all` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `tags_all` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `vpc_id` (`string`): Set the `vpc_id` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `vpc_id` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [aws.security_group.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`aws.security_group.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `security_group`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [aws.security_group.new](#fn-new), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `description` (`string`): Set the `description` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `egress` (`list`): Set the `egress` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `egress` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `ingress` (`list`): Set the `ingress` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `ingress` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name` (`string`): Set the `name` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `name` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name_prefix` (`string`): Set the `name_prefix` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `name_prefix` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `revoke_rules_on_delete` (`bool`): Set the `revoke_rules_on_delete` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `revoke_rules_on_delete` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `tags` (`obj`): Set the `tags` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `tags` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `tags_all` (`obj`): Set the `tags_all` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `tags_all` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `vpc_id` (`string`): Set the `vpc_id` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `vpc_id` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [aws.security_group.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
  - An attribute object that can be used with [tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) to construct a new `security_group` resource into the root Terraform configuration.
