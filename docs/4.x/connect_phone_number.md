## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`aws.connect_phone_number.new` injects a new `aws_connect_phone_number` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    aws.connect_phone_number.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `aws.connect_phone_number` using the reference:

    $._ref.aws_connect_phone_number.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ aws_connect_phone_number.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `country_code` (`string`): Set the `country_code` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `description` (`string`): Set the `description` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `prefix` (`string`): Set the `prefix` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `prefix` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `tags` (`obj`): Set the `tags` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `tags` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `tags_all` (`obj`): Set the `tags_all` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `tags_all` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `target_arn` (`string`): Set the `target_arn` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `type` (`string`): Set the `type` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [aws.connect_phone_number.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`aws.connect_phone_number.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `connect_phone_number`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [aws.connect_phone_number.new](#fn-new), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `country_code` (`string`): Set the `country_code` field on the resulting object.
  - `description` (`string`): Set the `description` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `prefix` (`string`): Set the `prefix` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `prefix` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `tags` (`obj`): Set the `tags` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `tags` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `tags_all` (`obj`): Set the `tags_all` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `tags_all` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `target_arn` (`string`): Set the `target_arn` field on the resulting object.
  - `type` (`string`): Set the `type` field on the resulting object.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [aws.connect_phone_number.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
  - An attribute object that can be used with [tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) to construct a new `connect_phone_number` resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn withCountryCode

```ts
withCountryCode()
```

`aws.string.withCountryCode` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the country_code field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `country_code` field.


### fn withDescription

```ts
withDescription()
```

`aws.string.withDescription` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the description field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `description` field.


### fn withPrefix

```ts
withPrefix()
```

`aws.string.withPrefix` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the prefix field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `prefix` field.


### fn withTags

```ts
withTags()
```

`aws.obj.withTags` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `obj`
Terraform resource block to set or update the tags field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`obj`): The value to set for the `tags` field.


### fn withTagsAll

```ts
withTagsAll()
```

`aws.obj.withTagsAll` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `obj`
Terraform resource block to set or update the tags_all field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`obj`): The value to set for the `tags_all` field.


### fn withTargetArn

```ts
withTargetArn()
```

`aws.string.withTargetArn` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the target_arn field.

  - `value` (`obj`): The value to set for the `timeouts` field.


### fn withTimeoutsMixin

This function will merge the passed in value to the existing map. If you wish
to instead replace the entire map with the passed in `value`, use the [aws.obj.withTimeouts](TODO)
function.


**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`obj`): The value to set for the `timeouts` field.


### fn withType

```ts
withType()
